/*

 Major Version
 Minor Version
 Build Number
 Revision 

 major = major version. (Kind of big changes, maybe even with UI refresh).
 minor = as medium set of changes. (maybe new internal processes or engines' refactoring).

 As for build and revision:

 0 - Means its alpha stage.
 1 - Beta.
 2 - Release candidate.

 So, if your app its on 3.2.1.0. You know you're at the alpha stage of the 3.2 version. And so on.
